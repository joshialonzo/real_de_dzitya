# Feature 07: Financial Reports

## Status
- **Current State**: Planned
- **Priority**: 🟠 High
- **Frontend Target**: Flutter (`/frontend`)
- **Backend Target**: Firebase Firestore (`/firebase`), Python (`/backend` — future, for Google Sheets export and WhatsApp bot)

## Overview
Reports aggregate payment and expense data into summaries that administrators can **view in-app**, **copy as formatted text to paste into WhatsApp**, or **export to Google Sheets**. This is the primary accountability tool for the condominium.

## Report Types

### 7a. Monthly Payments Report
Shows all payments received for a specific month.
- List of houses that paid, with amount and date.
- List of houses that did NOT pay (delinquent).
- Total collected vs. total expected.
- Collection rate percentage.

### 7b. Monthly Expenses Report
Shows all expenses incurred during a specific month.
- Breakdown by category with subtotals.
- Total spent.

### 7c. Monthly Balance Report
The executive summary combining 7a and 7b.
- Total income (payments).
- Total expenses.
- Net balance (income - expenses).
- Running accumulated balance (if tracked).

## User Stories
1. As an administrator, I want to select a month/year and instantly see a payments report.
2. As an administrator, I want to tap a "Copy to Clipboard" button that formats the report as clean WhatsApp-friendly text (with emojis and line breaks) so I can paste it directly into the community group chat.
3. As an administrator, I want to export a report to a Google Sheet so the oversight committee can audit it in spreadsheet format.
4. (Future) As a neighbor, I want to message the WhatsApp bot with "reporte abril 2026" and receive the monthly balance report automatically.

## Technical Notes
- **Clipboard**: Use Flutter's `Clipboard.setData()` to copy the formatted string.
- **Google Sheets**: Use the Google Sheets API via the Python backend. The admin provides a sheet ID, and the backend writes the report data as rows.
- **WhatsApp Bot**: Future feature using the WhatsApp Business API or a Twilio integration on the Python backend.
