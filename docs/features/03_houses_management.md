# Feature 03: Houses Management (CRUD)

## Status
- **Current State**: Planned
- **Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Data Foundation)
- **Frontend Target**: Flutter (`/frontend`)
- **Backend Target**: Firebase Firestore (`/firebase`)

## Overview
A **House** represents a physical property (lot) within the condominium. Each house belongs to exactly one Section and can have one or more Neighbors associated with it.

## User Stories
1. As an administrator, I want to create a new house record and assign it to a section so I can track it in the system.
2. As an administrator, I want to view all houses, optionally filtered by section.
3. As an administrator, I want to edit a house's details (e.g., address, lot number).
4. As an administrator, I want to see the payment status of a house at a glance (paid / delinquent).
5. As an administrator, I want to delete a house only if it has no neighbors or payment history.

## Data Model
```json
{
  "houseId": "string (auto-generated)",
  "sectionId": "string (FK to sections)",
  "lotNumber": "string (e.g., 'Lote 14')",
  "address": "string (e.g., 'Calle 10 #14')",
  "status": "string ('active' | 'vacant' | 'under_construction')",
  "currentBalance": "number (computed: total dues - total payments)",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

## UI Screens (Administrator)
1. **House List**: Filterable by section. Each card shows lot number, address, and a color-coded payment status badge (green = paid, red = delinquent).
2. **Create/Edit House**: Form with section dropdown, lot number, and address fields.
3. **House Detail**:  Shows the house info, its associated neighbors (Feature 04), and payment history (Feature 05).

## Validation Rules
- Lot number must be unique within a section.
- Cannot delete a house that has neighbors or payment records associated with it.
