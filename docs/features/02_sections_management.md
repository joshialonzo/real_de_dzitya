# Feature 02: Sections Management (CRUD)

## Status
- **Current State**: Planned
- **Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Data Foundation)
- **Frontend Target**: Flutter (`/frontend`)
- **Backend Target**: Firebase Firestore (`/firebase`)

## Overview
A **Section** is a logical grouping of houses — typically a street or a cluster of streets within the condominium. Sections are the top-level organizational unit.

## User Stories
1. As an administrator, I want to create a new section (e.g., "Calle 10") so I can organize houses by area.
2. As an administrator, I want to view a list of all sections with the count of houses in each.
3. As an administrator, I want to edit a section's name or description.
4. As an administrator, I want to delete a section only if it has no houses assigned to it.

## Data Model
```json
{
  "sectionId": "string (auto-generated)",
  "name": "string (e.g., 'Calle 10 - Poniente')",
  "description": "string (optional)",
  "houseCount": "number (computed/denormalized)",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "timestamp"
}
```

## UI Screens (Administrator)
1. **Section List**: Scrollable list/cards showing all sections with house counts.
2. **Create/Edit Section**: Simple form with name and optional description fields.
3. **Section Detail**: Tapping a section shows its associated houses (links to Feature 03).

## Validation Rules
- Section name must be unique.
- Cannot delete a section that still contains houses (show error message).
